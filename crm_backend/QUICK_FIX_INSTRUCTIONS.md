# Quick Fix Instructions for Call Metrics Issue

## The Problem
The call metrics are not showing because there's a mismatch between caller IDs and user_ids in the database:
- Callers have IDs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Call metrics have user_ids: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
- Frontend is looking for user_id = 1 but data exists at user_id = 9

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Connect to your MySQL database
```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name
```

### Step 2: Run the fix script
```sql
source fix_call_metrics_complete.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify the fix
The script will show you the before/after state and test the queries.

## What This Fix Does
1. ✅ **Fixes user_id mismatch**: Updates call_metrics.user_id to match caller IDs
2. ✅ **Adds missing fields**: Adds stage_fresh, stage_interested, etc. fields
3. ✅ **Populates stage data**: Fills in lead stage information from caller_details
4. ✅ **Tests the fix**: Verifies that frontend queries will work

## After Running the Fix
- Restart your Node.js backend
- Hot reload your Flutter app
- Navigate to Activity & Performance → Click any sales rep → See details
- You should now see all call metrics displayed!

## If You Still Have Issues
Run the test script to verify the API is working:
```bash
node test_call_metrics.js
```

You should see successful responses with data for each caller ID.
