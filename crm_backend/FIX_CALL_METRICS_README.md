# Fix Call Metrics Issue - Activity & Performance Screen

## Problem Description
When clicking on any sales rep in the Activity & Performance screen and then going to "Overall States" and clicking "See details", the call metrics (call made, last calls, all calls, incoming calls, outgoing calls, missed calls, etc.) are not being displayed.

## Root Cause
The issue is caused by:
1. **Missing data**: The `call_metrics` table has no data
2. **Foreign key constraint mismatch**: The table references the wrong table
3. **Database schema issues**: Missing sample data for testing

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Fix Database Schema
Run the migration script to fix the foreign key constraint and add sample data:

```bash
# Connect to your MySQL database
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name

# Run the migration script
source fix_call_metrics_schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Changes
After running the migration, you should see:
- 3 callers in the `callers` table
- 3 call metrics records in the `call_metrics` table  
- 3 caller details records in the `caller_details` table

### Step 3: Test Backend Endpoints
Run the test script to verify the API endpoints are working:

```bash
cd crm_backend
node test_call_metrics.js
```

Expected output should show successful responses with data.

### Step 4: Test Frontend
1. Start your Flutter app
2. Navigate to Activity & Performance
3. Click on any sales rep
4. Click "See details"
5. You should now see call metrics displayed

## What the Fix Does

### Database Schema Changes
- **Corrects foreign key**: `call_metrics.user_id` now properly references `callers.id`
- **Adds sample data**: Creates realistic call metrics for 3 sales reps
- **Ensures data consistency**: All tables have proper relationships

### Sample Data Added
Each sales rep now has:
- **John Doe**: 150 total calls, 120 connected, 30 not connected
- **Jane Smith**: 200 total calls, 160 connected, 40 not connected  
- **Mike Johnson**: 180 total calls, 140 connected, 40 not connected

### Call Metrics Include
- Total calls, incoming calls, outgoing calls
- Missed calls, connected calls, attempted calls
- Total duration in seconds
- Lead stage counts (fresh, interested, committed, not interested)

## Frontend Improvements
The CallerDetailScreen now:
- **Handles missing data gracefully**: Shows helpful message when no metrics found
- **Provides debugging information**: Shows what data was received
- **Better error handling**: Clear error messages with retry options
- **User-friendly feedback**: Explains why data might be missing

## Troubleshooting

### If Still No Data Shows
1. **Check database**: Verify tables have data
2. **Check backend logs**: Look for API errors
3. **Test endpoints**: Use the test script
4. **Check frontend console**: Look for JavaScript errors

### Common Issues
- **Database not updated**: Make sure migration script ran successfully
- **Backend not restarted**: Restart Node.js server after schema changes
- **Frontend cache**: Hot reload or restart Flutter app
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure backend is running on port 3000

## Verification
After applying the fix, you should see:
- ✅ Call metrics displayed for each sales rep
- ✅ Proper call counts and durations
- ✅ Lead stage information
- ✅ No more "no data found" messages
- ✅ Smooth navigation between screens

## Support
If issues persist after following these steps:
1. Check the debug information displayed in the frontend
2. Verify database tables have data
3. Test API endpoints manually
4. Check browser/Flutter console for errors
